# ChenZhaoqing's weekly reports
## Week1
### 1)learning hours:
       sum: roughly 20 hours
### 2)learning progress；
        I learnt the usage of C and created the linux environment .
        Now,I'm training my proficiency of linux instruction usage.
### 3）implementation：
        I commanded the basic usage of C.
        I knew the process of writing,compiling and running a C program.
        I can use gcc and gdb in the terminal.
        I configured the programming environment by writing the ".vscode" file on vscode, realizing the "auto-compiling".
        I can use git to synchronize my personal code on Github.
        I used Centos7 on vmware previously, but now I use Ubuntu20.04 on vmware to creat linux environment.
        I commanded the usage of mobaxterm, and successfully conneted my Ubuntu on vmware by SSH,so that I can program on mobaxterm succinctly.
        If the team offers the server ,I think I can connect it successfully.
### 4)problems：
     the writing of config file、configuring public and private keys for password-free login
### 5)plan;
      First,I'll go deep into the usage of insutruction in Linux（Ubuntu20.04），guaranteeing that I can develop in Linux environment expertly and efficiently.
      Next, I'll learn more about SSH and the writing of "config" file.
      Maybe,I'll try to learn the basic usage of C++.
      Then,I'll learn the knowledge of computer network to implement the task "echo server"， and if time permitting,I'll learn the multithreading 
      programming.
