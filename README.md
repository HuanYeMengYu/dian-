# ChenZhaoqing's weekly reports
## Week1
### 1)learning hours:
       sum: roughly 20 hours
### 2)learning progress；
        I learnt the usage of C and created the linux environment .
        Now,I'm training my proficiency of linux instruction usage.
### 3）implementation：
        I commanded the basic usage of C.
        I knew the process of writing,compiling and running a C program.
        I can use gcc and gdb in the terminal.
        I configured the programming environment by writing the ".vscode" file on vscode, realizing the "auto-compiling".
        I can use git to synchronize my personal code on Github.
        I used Centos7 on vmware previously, but now I use Ubuntu20.04 on vmware to creat linux environment.
        I commanded the usage of mobaxterm, and successfully conneted my Ubuntu on vmware by SSH,so that I can program on mobaxterm succinctly.
        If the team offers the server ,I think I can connect it successfully.
### 4)problems：
     the writing of config file、configuring public and private keys for password-free login
### 5)plan：
      First,I'll go deep into the usage of insutruction in Linux（Ubuntu20.04），guaranteeing that I can develop in Linux environment expertly and efficiently.
      Next, I'll learn more about SSH and the writing of "config" file.
      Maybe,I'll try to learn the basic usage of C++.
      Then,I'll learn the knowledge of computer network to implement the task "echo server"， and if time permitting,I'll learn the multithreading 
      programming.

## Week2
### 1)learning hours:
              sun:roughly 15 hours
### 2)learning progress；
                     I'm learning the Linux multitreading and the IO model.
### 3）implementation：
                     I learnt the computer network structure.
                     I understood the process of end-to-end communication.
                     I finished the "echo server" task on Linux by C.
### 4)problems：
                     Linux multitreading
### 5)plan：
             I tend to continue learning computer network,especially the Linux multitreading and the IO model.
             I'll learn the knowledge of communication.
### 6）week2 code:https://github.com/HuanYeMengYu/week2code
## Week3
### 1)learning hours:
       about 5~10hours（sommething happened accidently,and this week doesn't have weekends,so my learning hours declined）
### 2)learning progress；
       I'm learning knowledge of 5G and communication.
### 3）implementation：
       I tried the multithreading for a minimum model(only two threads with easy function)
       I have a basic understand about 5G
### 4)problems：
       how to server multi-user
### 5)plan：
       continue to learn network programming(multithreading and I/O model)
       continue to learn 5G and communication knowledge deeper
